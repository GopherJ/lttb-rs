# Largest Triangle Three Buckets

An implementation of the largest triangle three buckets (lttb)
algorithm for time series downsampling as described in
[Downsampling Time Series for Visual Representation](https://skemman.is/bitstream/1946/15343/3/SS_MSthesis.pdf).
This is a Rust port of
[the original Javascript implementation](https://github.com/sveinn-steinarsson/flot-downsample).
